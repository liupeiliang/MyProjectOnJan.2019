# MyProjectOnJan.2019
Real-time faces detection and recognition in video based on SVM and OpenCV
## Abstract
&ensp;&ensp;This project was mainly done by PeiliangLiu on Jan.2019. And I want to give my thanks to WenzeZhu, ZonghengXia and my supervisor for their helps.  
&ensp;&ensp;The final program can detect human face and mark that person's name on the real-time vedio(such as the vedio captured by laptop's camera).  
&ensp;&ensp;The codes I produced achieved a face-recognition rate of 93.7%, although that needs specific and constrained circumstance.  
&ensp;&ensp;In this Project, Python was the programming language and I also used many libraries such as opencv-python and sklearn, and they will be mentioned in details later.
